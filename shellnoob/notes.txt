Shellnoob notes

+ features
- python 2.4+
- relying only on as and objdump
- interactive mode (ins~>opcode, opcode~>ins)
- shellcode with starting breakpoint?

- inputs: shell, obj, bin, hex
- outputs: shell, obj, bin, hex, exe, C, python, bash, ruby, pretty
  (.pretty ~> like .S, but with the binary associated to each instruction:
  the opposite is like objdump's output)

+ modes
- convert
- interactive

+ TODO
- python 3.0 support
- readline interactive shell
- constant support! (on-the-fly!)
- 32/64bits switch!
